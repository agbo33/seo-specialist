Presenting my findings

In this final milestone, I will take all of the work I have done up to this point, put it all together into one cohesive Word or text document, and present your findings to the stakeholders involved. This milestone has two parts:

part 1: Detailed client report

I will develop a detailed report of my findings for my client. For each of my findings, I will provide a value for the priority of the item:

    Low priority will have minimal impact on their site. For example, this may have more of an indirect benefit such as boosting usability.

    Medium priority will have some impact, but it may be small or take a while to see the changes.

    High priority should be related to items that will have the biggest impact or are important elements of the site to optimize.

My final document should consist of the following sections:

Project Overview (50+ words)

An overview of the user or buyer, and how my recommendations will appeal to them (50+ words)

An overview of organic competitors and their individual strengths and weaknesses. Discuss the voice they use and how their audience responds to the type of content they produce. (100-200 words)

Technical Review Outline any technical issues found on the site, why these negatively impact SEO, and what you recommend doing to correct the issue. If no technical issues are found, describe the general health of the site and how this benefits SEO.

Content recommendations Create a section for each page of the site you analyzed. I will use the keyword map and content analysis notes to create this section. Each page analysis should include:

    The URL of the page, the keywords the page is targeting (if any) the keywords I will recommend the page target. Write a Title Tag and Meta Description for each page that uses your recommended keywords. This should be the appropriate character limit.

    An analysis of the heading tags of the page. Do I recommend adding any (if so, where?) Do I recommend changing existing heading tags (if so what is the current heading tag and what do you recommend changing it to?)

An analysis of the content on the page:

  I will  discuss the content and provide any recommendations I have for improving the content. Things to consider:

Should the content length be adjusted (should this be condensed with another page, or should the amount of content be increased?)

Does the content sufficiently use keywords?

Does the content link to other pages of the site where appropriate?

Does the content include additional resources such as images, videos, etc.?

Does the content include a call to action?

Does the content sufficiently address a buyer's question or concern that would have brought them to this page?

Create a section of recommended pages for the site: (minimum 5 pages)

    What keywords should this page use?

    What type of content can be provided?

    What potential issues does this address?

    What pages can this link to?

    Suggest a title tag and meta description

    Suggest an H1 and an H2 tag (what should it be and where should it be placed)

    Provide recommendations as to the length of the content.

    What resources can be included to make this page more search engine friendly?

    What kind of call to action can this page include?

Success Metrics In this area, list out any metrics the client will want to track to help gauge the success of their SEO efforts. These should be directly related to the goals you uncovered. If you were working with a real client – use their goals. If you were working on a site, you discovered list out metrics pertaining to the following goals:

    Provide a minimum of 5 metrics to monitor.

    Increase in rankings: What main keywords should they track to identify success in this area? What are things the client should be aware of when tracking rankings?

    Increase in Traffic: What Analytics metrics should be tracked here?

    User Engagement: What metrics should be tracked here?

Part 2: Video presentation


Once I have completed the full analysis and prepared my presentation, I will choose 1-2 of the most critical areas the site can improve upon. These areas or area is chosen based on what I believe will have the biggest impact for SEO. I will Create a video to present my findings. In this video I will give a brief, 1-2 minutes’ overview of my findings and how much opportunity I think the site has to improve if these recommendations are followed. Then spend 3-4 minutes discussing the critical areas I selected.
