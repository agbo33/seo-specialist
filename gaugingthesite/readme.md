In this first milestone, I will identify an existing section of my client's (or outside) website by using my skills to gauge a website’s opportunity for improvement and higher ranking. Once I have selected a website, I will create an SEO pitch to internal stakeholders, or potential clients, on why or how the website should be improved. Finally, I will develop a list of metrics that will help gather the information I need to begin to develop your SEO strategy to monitor and engage success. Let's get started! 

This milestone has been divided into three parts: Identify an existing section of The (or outside) website to create or modify, create an SEO pitch to internal stakeholders or potential client on why or how this website should be improved, and develop a list of metrics you'd use for your SEO strategy to monitor and engage success. You will need to create a PowerPoint or use other presentation software to create this milestone. Consider using transition slides to clearly identify the different parts of this milestone. If you are able, we recommend you upload your presentation as a PDF to allow better access for all peers.

Identify an existing section of the website

Estimated time 3-5 hours

The first stage of this project is to find the site I will be working on. Look at several different sites and gauge the level of effort needed to get the website to rank higher in search; look for opportunities throughout the website. Things to consider include:

    Are their title tags optimized?

    Do their pages lack substance?

    Are there errors while you are browsing their website?

Remember: The greater the level of effort needed to fix a website, the better success I will have with this project.

Whether this is a site I found online or an actual business owner I have reached out to, the site needs to contain a minimum of 10 pages. Be sure to list the name of the business and the URL to the website.

Create an SEO pitch

Estimated time 3-5 hours

Now that I have identified my client, I need to create a pitch to prove my value to the client. I will need to identify areas of opportunity and any low-hanging fruit that can be quickly fixed on the website. my pitch will need to include:

    5-10 slides: slides should only have 1-2 main points

    List of the website’s strengths (at least three examples) and weaknesses (area of opportunity)

    For each opportunity, develop an argument for why the website will likely rank better after improving it

    Include visual elements (screenshots, graphs, etc.) to show the client the issues for each slide

Remember: Don’t give away all of your ideas. They aren’t your client yet, so you want to give them enough to prove your worth.

Develope a list of metrics

Estimated time 1-2 hours

Once the client or organization agrees to either hire me or create an SEO strategy, I will need to create a list of 10-15 questions to ask a client or new manager about the website and business. The answers to these questions should help inform your SEO strategy going forward. 

The questions should:

    Relate to the client’s intended target audience

    The client’s goals for the site or business

    History of the site (ie, was there prior SEO work done before?)

    Any questions related to resources available and the website itself

Remember: I want to ask them enough questions for me to get a good idea of where to start and what success looks like to them.
