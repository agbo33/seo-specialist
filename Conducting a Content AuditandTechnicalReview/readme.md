conducting a technical audit and technical review

In this third milestone, I’ll examine the content of my competitors’ sites through a content audit to better position my own SEO campaign. You’ll also conduct an internal content audit to compare my site to those of my competitors and identify areas for improvement. Also in this milestone, I will develop a keyword matrix to help me determine which keywords should be assigned to specific pages on your site. In the final part of the milestone, I’ll perform a technical review of the site to identify any technical factors that may impact the ranking of the website. Each of these activities is critical to On-Page SEO.

    Complete a competitive content analysis.
    Complete an internal content audit.
    Analyze and create a keyword map.
    Analyze and report technical factor of the website.

    Complete a competitive content analysis.

Estimated Time: 3-5 hours

The type and quality of content produced is important to the success of your SEO campaign. Now you will need to further analyze the type of content your competitors are using effectively. Using the method outlined in our video covering Competitive Content Analysis, take a deeper look at top competitor’s sites to get an idea on the type of content that performs well, and how the audience responds to the content. You will need to analyze a minimum of two competitor sites. Use Excel or another spreadsheet tool to create a separate tab for each competitor and note the following:

    The URL of the page

    The type of content (static page, blog article, etc.)

    A description about what the content is

    Notes on that content. For example, is it a good resource with videos? Is this content duplicated elsewhere on the site?

    Social Media Metrics such as incoming links to that page, tweets and Facebook shares.

When I am done, I will write a minimum of 200 words describing what I may have learned about
the audience based on how they share and respond to content; and, the type of content that appeals to them most.  

Remember: 

Evaluating how well my competitors are producing content will help guide you in determining what type of content may perform best with my audience, what type of content is already out there, how you may be able to improve upon it, and whether or not there are any missed opportunities for content that nobody has taken advantage of.

Performing an internal content audit

Estimated Time 2-3 Hours

Now that we have a good idea on what type of content our competitors produce and how well the audience responds to that content, the next step is to look at the existing content on our own site and determining how this can be improved upon. You will need to select top level pages of your site based on your navigation. Select a minimum of 10 pages to analyze. 

I will want to make notes of the following:

    The page URL

    The type of content it is (text, image, etc)

    The seasonality of the content (if any)

    Whether or not the content contains images

    How this content targets the audience (directly, indirectly, etc)

    Whether or not the content includes a call to action (Remember this doesn’t have to be direct like “buy our blue widgets” but could also call on the viewer to read more blog posts, sign up for a newsletter, etc)

    Any notes about the content (for example, could the title be improved, should this use heading tags, does the content need to be expanded, etc) Strive to provide additional notes for at least half of the pages you analyze in an effort to get you to think critically about a page.

When I have completed your analysis of existing content. I will Brainstorm ideas for new pages/content for the site. Let my insights from your competitive evaluation, content analysis and keyword research guide you. Create five new content ideas for the site. These can be text based, video based, downloadable resources or any other ideas you might discover. List your idea, what keywords this would focus on, and how it meets an unfulfilled need.

Remember:
 I will want to analyze all major pages on the site, especially if I am working with a real client or on a long-term SEO contract. It’s important to keep a running internal content document.

 Creating a keyword map

Estimated Time:  1-2 Hours

Now that we have a good idea of the content that exists on the site, what might perform best, and the most effective keywords to use, it’s time to map out keywords to both existing and recommended pages on my website.

Using the Keyword Mapping process, create a keyword map for the pages you analyzed, include a minimum of 10 pages, as well as the additional five new page recommendations I have.

Remember: 

List the primary keywords for the page (the volume of the keyword and current page’s rank) as well as any secondary keywords and their volume and current rank.

Analyzing the technical factors

Estimated Time 1-2 Hours

Analyze any technical factors that may be negatively impacting the ability for search engine robots to crawl and analyze the content on the site. Review the site for the following technical issues:

Is there a robots.txt file?  

    If not, write up recommendations for why a robots.txt file should be created, and include any pages you suggest robots do not crawl. Explain your reasons.

    If there is an existing robots.txt file, analyze the file to see if it looks like it was properly setup. Are there any pages I recommend adding to the file? I will Explain my reasons.

Are there any error pages?  

    Crawl the site to discover any potential error page the site has. If you find any, list what pages are receiving an error, the error the page is receiving and what recommendation you have for correcting it. For example, is this a 404 page that could be better redirected to a new page
    on the site?

Remember: 

Make a list of the URL receiving the error, what the error is, and what my recommendations are to improve the error.
