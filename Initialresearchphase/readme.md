In this milestone, I will be entering into the initial research phase of the project. I have divided this milestone into three main parts: Developing a Persona, Performing Keyword Research, and Conducting a Competitive Analysis. This milestone should take me about 13-19 hours to do a thorough search and develop the different elements. You will upload one PDF file of either a Word/text document, PowerPoint/presentation document, or Excel/spreadsheet file with all three parts clearly defined for your peers.
