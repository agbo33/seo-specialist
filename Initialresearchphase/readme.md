In this milestone, I will be entering into the initial research phase of the project. I have divided this milestone into three main parts: Developing a Persona, Performing Keyword Research, and Conducting a Competitive Analysis. This milestone should take me about 13-19 hours to do a thorough search and develop the different elements. You will upload one PDF file of either a Word/text document, PowerPoint/presentation document, or Excel/spreadsheet file with all three parts clearly defined 
Initial research phase

Developing a persona

Estimated Time: 2-3 Hours

For any SEO Optimization Plan, I have to understand your target audience or buyer. In this part, I will need to develop a target user or buyer persona. You need to be able to answer the following questions about a target user or buyer that most closely resembles the average online visitor to your website:

    What gender is my target user likely to be?

    What age is my target user likely to be?

    What level of education might the target user have?

    What other topics might the target user be interested in?

    What are the primary ways my target users will discover your site? Social media, referrals from other websites, etc.

    Is my target user likely to be local to a specific area? If so, which area?  Does this impact the words they might use when searching for your product or services, and if so, how?

    What issues or problems are they trying to solve?

    What other information can I supply or infer about my target audience?

Write a short paragraph of a minimum of 150 words describing your persona and include an image that best resembles this buyer persona. Your paragraph should include the answers you found throughout your research.

Remember: Some sites that may be useful to my search include social media sites, like Facebook or Twitter, or sites that show website statistics, such as SimiliarWeb, Alexa, Quantcast, or other research studies found online like Forrester Research. 

Estimated Time: 3-5 Hours

For this part, I will need to perform thorough research on keywords, splitting up your keywords into specific topic areas. Think about how you can make the research process easier by concentrating on frequently used words and phrases with potential keywords like the textbook example presented in the lectures. 


Be sure to:

    Come up with a minimum of 25 keywords through your discovery.

    Split up the keywords into at least 3 themed groups for easier organization in an Excel file.

    Create a fourth group for long-tail queries related to questions the users might ask. Look for a minimum of three keywords around the “where”, “what”, “why”, and “how” keywords.

    Include transactional and informational keywords.  

    Highlight at least 10 keywords that you may recommend based on competitiveness and where the keywords are within the buyer’s journey. 

    Make notes about why you chose the keywords you did, as you will be required to present your findings in a final assignment. (Recommended)

Remember: The notes I make about the keywords could be as simple as a word describing the type of keyword it is (ie.“informational”) or a note describing what page the keyword might perform best on (ie. “possibly homepage”).

Performing keyword research is not enough if I want to ensure my SEO campaign is successful. We must also carefully analyze and select the keywords that are most likely to help the website perform well in search. For this part of the milestone, I will need to perform a competitive keyword search (Phase 1) as well as do some research on my competition (Phase 2). So keep in mind that there are two phases to this part.

Phase 1: Competitive Keyword Research

Estimated Time: 3-5 Hours

Perform a competitive analysis on the keywords you feel the website has the best chance of ranking for. Choose the keywords you feel will give you a good sense of the competition in the various themed areas you selected. For this assignment, perform competitive analysis on a minimum of four keywords. When you have successfully performed your research, list your top competitors in order of strongest to weakest for each keyword you selected. For each keyword I choose to analyze, be sure to include:

    The top four organic competitors listed on page one, plus the 10 or last competitor on page one should be listed.

    Write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) describing why this keyword was chosen for analysis.

Remember: Your keywords need to be differentiated enough so as not to compete with one another.

Phase 2: Evaluating Competition

Estimated Time – 5- 6 hours

After analyzing the competitive landscape of your chosen keywords, it’s time to look closely at the competitors you selected for each keyword to uncover opportunities for your site. Using the methods we discussed on evaluating our competition, examine your competitors’ sites and look at the pages that are ranking well and what elements on their pages are well-optimized. For each competitor listed in each keyword, you should be analyzing the following:

    Is it their homepage that is ranking for the chosen keyword, or a more specific page?

    Is the title tag of the ranking page optimized?

    Does the page have appropriate heading tags, and are they optimized?

    Rate the content of the page, and give it a score based on how well you feel the content is written, the length of the content, and the incorporation of keywords into the content.

    Does the page include additional resources, or is it just text and image-based?

    It’s also helpful to note down any domain-related trust and authority metrics. 

Remember:
Once I have analyzed these elements, I will consider how I may be able to use these insights to develop specific strategies for your site.
